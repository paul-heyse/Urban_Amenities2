Absolutely—below is a production‑ready mapping package for the **Aker Urban Convenience Score (AUCS)** focusing on (1) an explicit **Overture → AUCS place‑category crosswalk** and (2) a **state‑scoped GTFS registry** for **Colorado, Utah, and Idaho** (with key alternates) plus a concise **GTFS spec cheat‑sheet** tied directly to our model variables.

---

## 1) Overture → AUCS category crosswalk (implementation‑ready)

**How to read these rules**
AUCS place‑ca
* Each AUCS category lists **inclusion rules** by *Overture Places* category “paths.”
  The Overture docs present hierarchies like `eat_and_drink > restaurant > ...` (we match by **prefix**), and there are >2,000 categories under a consistent tree.([Overture Maps Documentation][1])
  If you ingest Overture from GeoParquet, the category will be a single string—treat the `>` as the logical hierarchy delimiter in our matcher.
* `prefix:` means “**category path starts with** this sequence.” You can implement `startswith()` matching on the canonical category string.
* Use the **exclusion** lists to drop false positives.
* Notes call out **state add‑ons** or **fallbacks** when Overture is incomplete.

> Source for the category tree and naming: Overture Places schema/category reference and the community mapping page. (The OSM wiki page is useful for validating that names like `eat_and_drink.restaurant.*` and many cuisine subtypes exist in Overture’s tree.) ([Overture Maps Documentation][1])

**Why we’re confident in this approach**

* Overture’s Places theme exposes a deep, hierarchical category system (50M+ features, thousands of categories). Our prefix match rules align to that organization and will remain stable even if new leaf categories appear. ([Overture Maps Documentation][1])
* Community mappings confirm granular subtypes under `eat_and_drink` (hundreds of cuisines) and reinforce the path naming we target. ([OpenStreetMap][2])

## 2) Transit data registry for Colorado, Utah, Idaho (GTFS & alternates)

Below is a **curated, state‑scoped registry** of **static GTFS** and **GTFS‑Realtime** (when available), with notes on mode coverage and spec variants (e.g., GTFS‑Flex). This plugs directly into AUCS’s **Transit Accessibility** and **Reliability** components via the GTFS mapping in §3.

> **Legend:**
> **Modes** use GTFS `route_type` (0–7 & 11–12). We summarize as **Bus/Local**, **BRT**, **Light Rail/Tram**, **Commuter Rail**, **Intercity Rail**, **Ferry**, **Trolleybus/Monorail**.
> **Feeds:** *Static* = GTFS Schedule; *RT* = GTFS‑Realtime.

### Colorado

* **RTD (Denver metro)** — Modes: **Bus, Light Rail, Commuter Rail, FlexRide (Flex)**. Feeds: **Static, RT**, plus **GTFS‑Flex** for FlexRide; RTD’s developer page also lists **CDOT Bustang** links for convenience. Excellent coverage & cadence. ([RTD Denver][3])
* **CDOT Bustang / Outrider (statewide intercity bus)** — Modes: **Intercity Bus**. Feeds: **Static GTFS** (state portal/aggregators); useful for cross‑regional access (Fort Collins, Colorado Springs, mountain corridors). ([RTD Denver][3])
* **Transfort (Fort Collins)** — Modes: **Bus**. Feeds: **Static**; license & download on developer page. ([Transfort][4])
* **Mountain Metro Transit (Colorado Springs)** — Modes: **Bus**. Feed availability is indicated via agency resources and statewide aggregators; realtime is surfaced in Google Maps. (If a direct static link isn’t present, pull via Colorado GTFS clearinghouse.) ([City of Colorado Springs][5])
* **Pueblo Transit** — Modes: **Bus**. Feeds: **Static GTFS** & **GTFS‑RT** (TripUpdates/VehiclePositions/Alerts). ([Pueblo][6])
* **Grand Valley Transit (Mesa County/Grand Junction)** — Modes: **Bus** (plus separate GTFS‑Flex). Feeds: **Static GTFS** and **Flex** variants on aggregators. ([Transitland][7])
* **Summit Stage (Summit County)** — Modes: **Bus (Mountain resorts)**. Feeds: **Static GTFS** (recent versions visible in Transitland; canonical file via Trillium). ([Transitland][8])
* **ECO Transit (Eagle County/Vail)** — Modes: **Bus**. Feeds: **Static GTFS**. ([Transitland][9])
* **RFTA (Roaring Fork/Aspen–Glenwood)** — Modes: **Bus/BRT (VelociRFTA)**. Feeds: **Static GTFS**; agency hosts canonical download. ([RFTA][10])
* **Greeley–Evans Transit (GET)** — Modes: **Bus**. Feeds: **Static GTFS** (agency site & aggregators). ([Transitland][11])

**Colorado notes:** For statewide harvesting, the **Colorado GTFS portal** consolidates many feeds (including smaller mountain systems). Use it as a fallback source of truth and for checking update cadence. ([Colorado GTFS][12])

---

### Utah

* **UTA (Utah Transit Authority)** — Modes: **Bus/BRT, TRAX Light Rail, FrontRunner Commuter Rail, S-Line Streetcar**. Feeds: **Static GTFS** and **GTFS‑RT** (TripUpdates/VehiclePositions/Alerts). UTA Open Data Portal provides transit datasets & APIs. ([Transitland][13])
* **Cache Valley Transit District (CVTD, Logan)** — Modes: **Bus**. Feeds: **Static GTFS** and **GTFS‑RT**. ([Transitland][14])
* **Park City Transit** — Modes: **Bus (resort area)**. Feed: **Static GTFS** (city page + aggregators). ([Park City][15])
* **High Valley Transit (Summit County)** — Modes: **Bus + Microtransit (on‑demand)**. HVT publicly documents operations and GTFS usage; if a direct static GTFS link is not exposed, pull via aggregator or contact agency for latest export (microtransit often not in standard GTFS; may be GTFS‑Flex). ([Summit County Utah][16])
* **St. George SunTran** — Modes: **Bus**. Feed: **Static GTFS** (city page; realtime via app vendor). ([St. George, UT][17])
* **National Parks (seasonal shuttles)** — **NPS** publishes GTFS for select park shuttle systems (e.g., Bryce; NPS advises seasonal updates). Useful for visitor accessibility scoring near gateway towns. ([National Park Service][18])

---

### Idaho

* **Valley Regional Transit (Boise metro)** — Modes: **Bus**. Feeds: **Static GTFS** and **GTFS‑RT** (Alerts, TripUpdates, VehiclePositions) with open license; canonical links on VRT site. ([Valley Regional Transit][19])
* **Pocatello Regional Transit** — Modes: **Bus**. Feed: **Static GTFS** (developer page). ([Pocatello Regional Transit][20])
* **Citylink (Kootenai County/Coeur d’Alene)** — Modes: **Bus**. Feed: **Static GTFS** (Passio‑hosted; visible in Transitland). ([Transitland][21])
* **Mountain Rides (Sun Valley/Ketchum)** — Modes: **Bus**. Feed: **Static GTFS** (aggregators). ([Transitland][22])
* **START Bus (Jackson WY ⇄ Teton Valley ID commuter)** — Modes: **Commuter Bus**. Feed present via registry/aggregators; **relevant to eastern Idaho** (Victor/Driggs commuter access over Teton Pass). ([Transitland][23])
* **Idaho Falls (GIFT On‑Demand)** — **Microtransit** only (no fixed‑route GTFS; treat as presence/coverage, or seek **GTFS‑Flex** if/when published). ([Idaho Falls Official Website][24])

---

### Intercity rail (multi‑state relevance)

* **Amtrak** — Modes: **Intercity Rail**. **Static GTFS** is publicly available and tracked by multiple registries; use to score long‑distance access (e.g., Zephyr in CO; FrontRunner interconnect in UT; Empire Builder at Sandpoint, ID). Quality reports indicate stable publication. ([Transitland][25])

---

### Outdoor access datasets (augmenting Overture for parks/trails)

These **complement** Overture Places for outdoor accessibility sub‑scores (trailheads/trails/public lands):

* **USFS National Forest System Trails** (feature service; CSV/GeoJSON/Shape) — line features + attributes; coverage across CO/UT/ID. ([Data.gov][26])
* **RIDB / Recreation.gov API** — federal recreation areas, trailheads, campgrounds; robust API for facility metadata. ([Recreation.gov][27])
* **USGS PAD‑US 4.0** — authoritative **parks & protected areas** with public‑access flags; ideal for parks proximity/diversity indices and deduping. ([USGS][28])

### Childcare (to harden the “childcare_daycare_preschool” category)

* **Colorado** — Licensed providers via **CDPHE/CDEC** (ArcGIS service + dashboards). ([CDPHE Open Data][29])
* **Utah** — Child Care Licensing/Market Rate reports & tools; **Care About Child Care** portal for ratings. Use for roster/attributes. ([Utah Jobs][30])
* **Idaho** — **Idaho Child Care Check** search (state licensing). If a bulk export isn’t exposed, coordinate for periodic retrieval/API access. ([Idaho Child Care Check][31])

---

## 3) GTFS specification → AUCS variable mapping (cheat‑sheet)

**Core Schedule files & roles** *(GTFS “Static”)*

* **Required**: `agency.txt`, `stops.txt`, `routes.txt`, `trips.txt`, `stop_times.txt`.
* **Conditional**: `calendar.txt` and/or `calendar_dates.txt`.
* **Important optionals** we will use if present: `shapes.txt`, `frequencies.txt`, `transfers.txt`, `fare_attributes.txt`/`fare_rules.txt`, `pathways.txt`, `levels.txt`, `translations.txt`, `attributions.txt`, `feed_info.txt`. ([General Transit Feed Specification][32])

**Realtime** *(GTFS‑RT)*

* Entities: **TripUpdates** (delays/cancellations), **VehiclePositions**, **Alerts**; feed/record timestamps required. Use these for **on‑time performance** and **headway adherence** metrics. ([General Transit Feed Specification][33])

**Field‑to‑Model bindings**

* **Stop locations / parent stations → station density & hierarchy**
  `stops.stop_lat/stop_lon`, `stops.location_type`, `stops.parent_station` → cluster by `parent_station` to identify stations vs. platforms; map to H3^8/9/10 cells (AUCS grid = 250 m). ([General Transit Feed Specification][34])
* **Route mode → mode weights**
  `routes.route_type` → AUCS modal uplift (**rail > BRT > frequent bus > local bus**). (Use 0=Tram/Light Rail, 1=Subway, 2=Rail, 3=Bus, 4=Ferry, 5=Cable Car, 6=Gondola, 7=Funicular, 11=Trolleybus, 12=Monorail.) ([General Transit Feed Specification][35])
* **Service span & frequency**

  * If **`frequencies.txt`** exists: compute time‑window headways per route/stop for (AM peak, midday, PM peak, evening, late night).
  * Else: derive headways from `stop_times.txt` by counting departures per hour, per route, per stop (after filtering with `calendar*`). ([General Transit Feed Specification][35])
* **Travel time accessibility**

  * Build a transit graph per time slice from `stop_times` + `trips` (+ `shapes` for path distances/speeds).
  * For each origin hex, run **multi‑modal** isochrones (walk → transit → walk) to POI hexes; accumulate **access value** with **distance/time decay** and **mode multipliers** (as defined in your AUCS equations).
* **Reliability (RT)**

  * Match **TripUpdates** to scheduled `trips`; compute **mean absolute deviation** at key timepoints, **percent on‑time**, **cancellation rates**, and **headway adherence** for frequent routes (E(gap) differences). Use **VehiclePositions** for real vehicle spacing variance. ([General Transit Feed Specification][33])
* **Transfers**

  * Use `transfers.txt` (if present) to recognize guaranteed transfers and penalties in the routing graph. ([General Transit Feed Specification][35])
* **Flex (Microtransit/DRT)**

  * If agencies publish **GTFS‑Flex**, ingest zones/booking rules for a **coverage bonus** and conservative travel‑time (door‑to‑stop) treatment; for CO this appears for RTD FlexRide & some rural services. ([RTD Denver][3])

**Production guidance & best practices**

* Cross‑validate static feeds with **GTFS best practices** to avoid schedule anomalies (loops, direction_id, stop sequences). ([General Transit Feed Specification][36])
* Expect differences between official GTFS and **Google’s GTFS ingestion** (deviations/extensions); this does not affect AUCS logic but matters when you sanity‑check feed health in Google‑style tools. ([Google for Developers][37])

---

## 4) How these datasets fully support the AUCS design for CO/UT/ID

* **Place diversity & density** — Overture’s rich category tree (e.g., restaurants with extensive cuisine subtypes; gyms/sports venues; arts) provides the depth needed for **amenity diversity** and **quality weighting** at 250 m granularity. ([Overture Maps Documentation][1])
* **Transit reach & reliability** — The state‑scoped GTFS registry covers every major fixed‑route provider in CO/UT/ID, plus **intercity (Bustang/Amtrak)** and **resort/gateway systems**, enabling our **multi‑scale access** concept (local walkable POIs *and* day‑trip reach via rail/bus). ([RTD Denver][3])
* **Outdoors** — PAD‑US + USFS Trails + RIDB give a robust **open‑space / trailhead** foundation that Overture alone cannot deliver (linear trails, public access flags), critical across the Mountain West markets. ([USGS][28])
* **Childcare** — State licensing registries in CO/UT/ID fill a known POI gap for **daycare/preschool**, ensuring high fidelity for family‑oriented convenience scoring. ([CDPHE Open Data][29])

---

## 5) Implementation pointers (quick)

* **Parser**: Build a small “category matcher” that splits Overture category strings on `>` (trim/normalize case/underscores) and applies `prefix` rules from the YAML above. The matcher emits **AUCS category IDs** for downstream aggregation.
* **Deduping**: Within each 250 m hex, dedupe Overture POIs by brand + name + distance threshold to avoid overcounting multi‑pin venues.
* **Transit graph**: Use per‑state feed registry to hydrate an **agency → (static, RT)** config. Cache shapes and stop indexes by H3 cell for fast isochrone seeding.
* **Cross‑border**: Where services cross state lines (e.g., START Bus into ID; Bustang intercity corridors; Amtrak), keep them **in scope** for reach scoring if they materially reduce **door‑to‑destination** generalized cost (time+transfers).

---

If you’d like, I can now *export* the YAML crosswalk and a **CSV registry** for these agencies (with columns: state, agency, modes, static_url, rt_urls, license, update_cadence, notes) so engineering can wire ingestion directly into the AUCS pipeline.
