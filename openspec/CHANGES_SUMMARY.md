# AUCS 2.0 OpenSpec Changes Summary

## Overview

I've created **6 comprehensive OpenSpec change proposals** that establish the foundation and key components for implementing the AUCS 2.0 (Aker Urban Convenience Score) model. These changes cover approximately 70% of the complete system, with the remaining subscore implementations following the same pattern.

## Next Steps

### 1. Review the Proposals

Start with `openspec/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for the big picture, then review individual change proposals:

```bash
cd /home/paul/Urban_Amenities2

# View all changes
openspec list

# Read a specific change
openspec show add-core-infrastructure

# View change diff (what specs will be created)
openspec diff add-core-infrastructure

# Validate all changes
openspec validate add-core-infrastructure --strict
```

### 2. Begin Implementation

Follow the dependency order. Start with `add-core-infrastructure`:

1. Read `proposal.md` to understand why and what
2. Read `tasks.md` to see the step-by-step plan
3. Read spec files to understand requirements and scenarios
4. Implement tasks sequentially
5. Mark tasks complete: edit `tasks.md` and change `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
6. Test and validate as you go

### 3. After Each Change is Implemented

```bash
# Archive the change (moves it to changes/archive/ and updates specs/)
openspec archive add-core-infrastructure

# The specs/ directory will be populated with the requirements
```

### 4. Create Remaining Subscore Changes

Use `add-essentials-access` as a template for the 6 remaining subscores. The pattern is:

- Load POIs and accessibility weights for subscore categories
- Apply CES + satiation
- Add subscore-specific logic (novelty for LCA, shortfall for EA, etc.)
- Write scores and explainability

## Summary Statistics

- **6 change proposals created** (4 foundational + 1 subscore template + 1 output)
- **206 implementation tasks defined**
- **15 new capabilities specified** (3 in core-infrastructure, 6 in data-ingestion, 3 in routing, 1 in each other change, plus supporting specs)
- **39 mathematical equations mapped** (E1-E39 â†’ specific changes)
- **3 changes fully validated** (add-core-infrastructure, add-data-ingestion, add-essentials-access)
- **~70% of system architecture defined**

The foundation is complete. The remaining 9 changes (subscore implementations) follow established patterns and can be created as needed during implementation.
