# spatial-grid Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-core-infrastructure. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: H3 Hexagon Resolution

The system SHALL use H3 resolution 9 (approximately 250m edge length) for all spatial computations.

#### Scenario: Convert coordinates to hexagons

- **WHEN** a latitude/longitude point is provided
- **THEN** the system SHALL return the H3 resolution 9 cell identifier containing that point

#### Scenario: Hexagon resolution consistency

- **WHEN** any geographic feature is indexed
- **THEN** the system SHALL use resolution 9 for consistent spatial granularity

### Requirement: Spatial Indexing

The system SHALL assign H3 hexagon identifiers to all geographic features (POIs, stops, segments, blocks).

#### Scenario: Index point features

- **WHEN** a point feature (POI, stop, airport) has lat/lon coordinates
- **THEN** the system SHALL assign the containing H3 cell as hex_id

#### Scenario: Index linear features

- **WHEN** a linear feature (road segment, trail) is provided
- **THEN** the system SHALL assign hex_id based on segment midpoint or sample points

#### Scenario: Index polygon features (area-weighted)

- **WHEN** a polygon feature (park, census block) intersects multiple hexagons
- **THEN** the system SHALL distribute attributes to hexagons using area-weighted allocation

### Requirement: Hexagon Geometry Operations

The system SHALL provide geometric operations on hexagons for spatial analysis.

#### Scenario: Compute hex centroids

- **WHEN** a hex_id is provided
- **THEN** the system SHALL return the centroid latitude and longitude

#### Scenario: Compute hex boundaries

- **WHEN** visualization or detailed spatial analysis is needed
- **THEN** the system SHALL return the hex boundary as a GeoJSON polygon

#### Scenario: Compute inter-hex distances

- **WHEN** computing travel between hexagons
- **THEN** the system SHALL provide great-circle distance between hex centroids

#### Scenario: Find neighbor hexagons

- **WHEN** computing accessibility within a buffer distance
- **THEN** the system SHALL return k-ring neighbors up to the specified distance

### Requirement: Spatial Aggregation

The system SHALL aggregate metrics from points, lines, and polygons to hexagons.

#### Scenario: Aggregate POI counts per hex

- **WHEN** multiple POIs fall within the same hexagon
- **THEN** the system SHALL group them by hex_id and aucstype for category counting

#### Scenario: Aggregate continuous values (area-weighted)

- **WHEN** census block populations intersect multiple hexagons
- **THEN** the system SHALL allocate population proportional to intersection area

### Requirement: Spatial Join Performance

The system SHALL perform spatial joins efficiently for large datasets (millions of features).

#### Scenario: Handle statewide POI indexing

- **WHEN** indexing 100K+ POIs to hexagons in Colorado/Utah/Idaho
- **THEN** the operation SHALL complete in under 5 minutes on standard hardware

#### Scenario: Use vectorized operations

- **WHEN** performing bulk spatial operations
- **THEN** the system SHALL use numpy/pandas vectorization rather than Python loops
