# QA Capability

## Purpose

Track cross-cutting QA improvements, including coverage, regression testing, and reliability metrics.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Coverage Improvement Initiatives

The QA function SHALL manage coverage improvement changes that span multiple modules.

#### Scenario: Coverage initiatives tracked
- **WHEN** a coverage-focused change is completed
- **THEN** the QA spec SHALL record the updated targets and verification steps

### Requirement: Global Test Coverage Targets

QA SHALL enforce cross-cutting coverage thresholds and document compliance.

#### Scenario: Coverage gate tracked
- **WHEN** a coverage initiative updates thresholds (e.g., â‰¥95% total coverage, module minimums)
- **THEN** the QA spec SHALL log the new targets and their verification status
- **AND** the CI coverage gate SHALL be adjusted accordingly

### Requirement: Test Quality Assurance
The project SHALL maintain automated test coverage thresholds of at least 95% line coverage and 90% branch coverage across all first-party Python modules.

#### Scenario: Coverage thresholds enforced
- **WHEN** the test suite runs in CI
- **THEN** coverage metrics are collected and compared against the configured thresholds
- **AND** the pipeline FAILS if thresholds are not met

#### Scenario: Coverage dashboards updated
- **WHEN** a pull request completes CI successfully
- **THEN** the coverage report is published as an artifact or comment for reviewer visibility

#### Scenario: Contributors guided on coverage expectations
- **WHEN** a developer consults project contribution documentation
- **THEN** they find clear guidance on coverage targets and strategies for adding or updating tests
