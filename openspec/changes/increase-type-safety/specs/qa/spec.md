## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Static Type Coverage
The project SHALL maintain a mypy configuration that executes on every CI run with zero type errors and no unchecked `# type: ignore` suppressions, except for explicitly documented third-party boundaries.

#### Scenario: CI type check enforcement
- **WHEN** a pull request triggers the CI pipeline
- **THEN** mypy runs against the repository with project-configured settings
- **AND** the pipeline FAILS if mypy reports errors or unused ignore directives

#### Scenario: Suppression governance
- **WHEN** a developer introduces a `# type: ignore` directive
- **THEN** it MUST include a justification referencing the tracked exception list, and mypy SHALL confirm the directive is necessary (no unused ignores)

#### Scenario: Contributor guidance
- **WHEN** a contributor consults project documentation
- **THEN** they find guidance on running mypy locally, required stub packages, and preferred typing patterns for dynamic data structures
