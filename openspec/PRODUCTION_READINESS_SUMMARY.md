**10 Major Decisions:**

1. OSRM Deployment Architecture (3 separate instances)
2. OTP2 Graph Scope (single regional graph for CO/UT/ID)
3. Error Handling Strategy (retry, circuit breaker, graceful degradation)
4. Testing Strategy (unit â†’ integration â†’ pilot)
5. Monitoring and Observability (structured logs, metrics, health checks)
6. Parameter Configuration Management (YAML + Pydantic + versioning)

## Special Focus: External Database/Service Integrations

Given the fragility of external integrations, the proposal provides exceptional detail on:

### OSRM Integration

- **Graph building**: Step-by-step OSM data conversion, profile-specific extraction/contraction
- **Deployment**: Docker architecture, resource requirements (12GB RAM total), port configuration
- **Error handling**: Retry logic (3 attempts, exponential backoff), "no route found" graceful handling, logging
- **Monitoring**: Health checks (5s timeout), response time tracking (p95 <500ms), success rate (>95%)
- **Maintenance**: Graph versioning, rebuild automation, rollback procedures

### OTP2 Integration

- **Graph building**: GTFS feed collection via Transitland, validation with gtfs-kit, multi-feed ingestion
- **Deployment**: JVM configuration, memory allocation (8-16GB), GraphQL endpoint setup
- **Error handling**: GraphQL error parsing, retry policy, fallback to non-transit modes
- **Monitoring**: Health checks (10s timeout), query response times (p95 <2s), error categorization
- **Maintenance**: Weekly graph rebuilds, feed monitoring, automated updates

### External APIs (Wikipedia, Wikidata, etc.)

- **Credential management**: Secrets manager integration, environment variables, quarterly rotation
- **Rate limiting**: Respectful limits (100 req/sec Wikipedia, 10 req/sec Wikidata), 429 handling
- **Caching**: Persistent cache with TTL (24h Wikipedia, 7d Wikidata), 10GB size limit
- **Circuit breakers**: Open after 5 failures, half-open after 60s, stale cache fallback
- **Monitoring**: Success rate tracking, latency histograms, error categorization

### Data Sources (Overture, GTFS, NOAA, etc.)

- **Download automation**: Idempotent scripts, checksum verification, provenance tracking
- **Versioning**: Manifest with sources/versions/timestamps, git tracking, reproducibility
- **Validation**: Schema checks (Pandera), GTFS validation (gtfs-kit), completeness checks
- **Freshness monitoring**: Age warnings (>90 days), automated refresh triggers, staleness alerts
- **Quality assurance**: Coverage metrics, anomaly detection, ground truth comparison

- **9 change proposals remain**: Feature work (subscores 2-7, amenity quality, category aggregation, explainability)
- **External services critical**: System absolutely requires OSRM and OTP2 to function
- **Comprehensive coverage**: 310 tasks cover all aspects of production readiness

**This proposal transforms AUCS 2.0 from "code complete" to "production ready."**
